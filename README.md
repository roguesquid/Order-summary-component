## Overview

The "Order Summary Component" challenge goal is to build a card with information (title, description, price and some buttons) of an order made in an ecommerce website.

The main challenge of this card is the great quantity of divs and BEM classes you need to write but regardless of that it's so easy to do.

## My process

The first thing i do is to write the HTML, analazing where should i group tags into a div, then i start writing the BEM classes in each tag (it's important to make this step thinking of reusability), from father tags to son tags. After that i start writing the CSS starting with the variables, then i go with base styles (like setting margins and paddings to 0), after that i start writing the custom tags. Finally when i'm happy with the result i start searching for bugs to avoid future problems.

### Built with
